# Titanic-Crash-Analysis
I have split this project into 2 parts- performing an exploratory data analysis and building a logistic regression model to predict if a passenger would be able to survive a Titanic Crash.

## Motivation
Everyone knows about the huge unfornate incident of Titanic crash, we also have the dataset containing the information of all the passengers present during the crash readily available on the web. Why don't we simply use it to predict what kind of passengers were given high priority to rescue first? I wanted my first project on GitHub to be really meaningful and not just anything for the sake of it. I initially performed this whole piece of code in R but then writing it on Python was a completely different experience.

## Pre-requisites
- Basics of Python programming (refer: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/break-and-continue-statements)
- Basics of Machine Learning Algorithms, more specifically Logistic Regression Model (refer: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/understanding-logistic-regression-python)

## Libraries used

- numPy : for basic and high level algebra
- pandas : for data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib.pyplot : for generating plots and histograms
- seaborn : for high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
- warnings : to essentially ignore the warnings 
- sklearn : for performing logistic regression
